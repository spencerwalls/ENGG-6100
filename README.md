My work from the graduate-level Machine Vision course at the University of Guelph, including the following:
- An assignment pertaining to 3D pose estimation / the Amazon Picking Challenge (APC) whereby the solution employs a Convolutional Neural  Network (CNN)
- My final project for the course which applied a transfer learning approach using several CNN architectures to the UC Merced Land-use datasets
