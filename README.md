My work from the graduate-level Machine Vision course at the University of Guelph, which includes the following:
- An assignment pertaining to 3D pose estimation / the Amazon Picking Challenge (APC) whereby the solution employs Convolutional Neural  Networks (CNNs).
- My final project for the course, which involved using transfer learning on several CNN architectures pretained on <em>ImageNet</em> to solve the land-use classification problem defined by the <em>UC Merced Land-use</em> dataset.
